# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a high school student from Germany with ambitious goals in mind.
In the future, I plan on starting my own company to provide real solutions for real problems.

I spend part of my time learning about programming and computers.
When I started off, I used to develop smaller programs using Python,
after which, I later began looking into web development.

Django used to be my tool of choice
and I still use it too date,
but I have since started to work with more modern approaches,
including Next.js.

Apart from programming, I've also looked into Linux server administration.
This includes setting up servers and CI/CD pipelines for my projects.

I'm currently not too active on GitHub since I'm busy with other projects.
Feel free to check out my [blog](https://quoorex.com/blog) in the meantime, where I regularly post new content.
